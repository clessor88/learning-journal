                <h4>Today we went over heaps. While the concept is easy, coding them is fairly difficult. my partner and I ran into a few issues getting our push function to sort our max heap when there are only 2 in the heap. Also, our learning journal project with pyramid is on day 2. Windows will not let me do what i need to do to the run file. I'm currently talking to Kent for possible solutions to this issue.</h4>
